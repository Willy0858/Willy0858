Good evening, I have a little problem with my zonestar M9V5 Pro.
I can't manage to print in 4 or more colors as I can't add a wipe tower.
Added the tool, but when I use it I only get 1 layer and with very strange starting points.
Already have a movie on youtube confesses but when I do the same cura always says there is nothing to save because there is no object.
Can anyone explain to me how it really works.

I would also like to know how I can get my printer 100% leveled, I also have trouble with that, and when I use auto leveling it goes completely wrong.

Thanks in advance for your help.
